# Pause-Button-Replacement
Replaces the "Pause-Break" button with a Window Screenshot and saves it.

Copy this file to Startup to have it always run with your machine:
C:\Users\Adam\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
Adam's Windows Mods 4 - Replace Pause Key

Before this works optimally, you probably want to open a blank MSPaint document, set the size to something small, then close it and "Don't Save" - that way your default size is small enough to accommodate window screenshots without extra white space! 
Just a tip
